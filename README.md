# Dice Game - JavaScript Two Player Game

This is a simple two-player dice game created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## How to Play

- The game is for two players. Each player takes turns to either **roll the dice** or **hold** their score.
- When a player **rolls the dice**, their current score accumulates the number rolled. However, if the player rolls a **1**, their current score resets to 0, and it becomes the next player's turn.
- A player can also **hold** their score. If they do, their current score is added to their total score, and it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach or exceed **100 points** wins the game.

## Rules

- If you roll a **1**, your current score resets to **0**, and your turn ends.
- If you choose to **hold**, your current score is added to your total score, and your turn ends.
- The goal is to reach a total score of **100** or more before the other player.
